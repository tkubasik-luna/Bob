"""Per-run tool-result store (blackboard) + deterministic projections.

PRD 0009 — *Tool Result Store & Deterministic Deliverable Projection*.

A weak local model in the sub-agent control loop fails the
``request → tool → display`` flow two ways at once (see the 2026-05-30
mail-overlay investigation):

1. the full tool-result blob is replayed into every prompt, so the model
   drowns in its own transcript and loses track that the answer is already
   in hand (it then spins ``progress`` and never emits ``done``);
2. the structured deliverable (a Mail card) depends on the model emitting a
   perfect ``done`` payload — so on any forced exit the card dies even though
   the data exists.

This module is the architectural fix for both. It is a **blackboard**: each
successful tool result is written to a per-run store keyed by a short,
human-readable ``ref`` (``"gmail_search#1"``). Writing also runs the tool's
**projector** — a pure ``result -> ProjectedResult`` function owning the three
projections of that result:

- ``digest`` — a *compact* preview that goes into the ``tool`` transcript
  message instead of the full blob (fixes #1, the context bloat);
- ``deliverable`` — the ``{component, props}`` UI descriptor, built by code
  from data that already exists, so it survives *every* termination path
  (fixes #2 — the model is removed from the display-critical path);
- ``summary`` — a deterministic spoken/markdown summary;

plus ``terminal`` — whether this result is itself a complete answer (a
single-shot lookup like a mail search), which lets the runner *converge*
deterministically instead of waiting for the weak model to conclude.

The store is intentionally tiny and dependency-free (no pydantic, no
``ui_registry`` import): the runner validates a projected ``deliverable``
against the single ``ui_registry`` schema at the boundary. Keeping projection
*data* here and validation *there* mirrors the OpenClaw rule the codec layer
already follows — "core owns the loop; providers own the runtime hooks."
