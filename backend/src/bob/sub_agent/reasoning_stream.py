"""Reasoning-stream reader — separated cosmetic + action channels (PRD 0011 / issue 0069).

The foundational tracer-bullet of the agent-activity feed. A sub-agent LLM call
is STREAMED (via :meth:`bob.llm_client.LLMClient.stream_chat`) so the model's
chain-of-thought can surface live in the HUD while the call is still running.
But the sub-agent's control envelope (the :class:`bob.sub_agent.actions.SubAgentAction`)
must STILL be parsed from the final aggregated content exactly as the
non-streaming ``chat`` path did — reasoning is purely cosmetic and has ZERO
correctness impact.

:class:`ReasoningStreamReader` owns that split. It consumes a
``StreamChunk`` async-iterator and exposes two channels:

- a live iterator of reasoning deltas (``reasoning`` chunks' ``reasoning_delta``),
  in order, for the caller to forward to the feed as they arrive;
- the aggregated ``content`` (``text`` chunks concatenated), collected to the end
  and read once the stream is exhausted — this is what the action is parsed from.

It also detects the ABSENCE of a reasoning channel: a stream that never carries a
``reasoning`` chunk (a model / endpoint without ``reasoning_content``) leaves
:attr:`degraded` ``True`` — the hook issue 0070 builds its narrated-steps
fallback on. Here we only expose the fact.

Usage::

    reader = ReasoningStreamReader(client.stream_chat(messages, schema=schema))
    async for delta in reader.reasoning_deltas():
        await emit_reasoning(delta)   # cosmetic, live
    content = reader.content          # aggregated, parse the action from THIS
    if reader.degraded:
        ...                           # no reasoning channel (0070 hook)

The reasoning iterator drives the consumption of the underlying stream; reading
:attr:`content` / :attr:`degraded` before the iterator is exhausted raises, so a
caller can never accidentally parse a half-collected envelope.
